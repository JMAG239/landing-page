# landing-page
This is my first landing page, made for practice!

The objective of this project is to practice all the skills I learned in the flexbox and box models lessons.
To do that, I'll be recreating a common form of template for a given page, trying to make it look good in the process!

Hopefully this will help me in my journey to become  a web developer.
